# Philia 1.0
Philia 1.0 program is a stock-flow consistent (SFC) model that shows how money circulates between different economic agents, households, businesses, government and banks, which can be run under EVIEWS:
- It enables economic policies to be evaluated in a variety of scenarios, giving decision-makers a clear view of the potential advantages and disadvantages of their choices. 
- It facilitates understanding of the interactions between economic sectors. 
- Its eco-systemic block allows addressing contemporary issues of sustainable development.
- It can be enriched to reflect the growing complexity of the economy, by integrating new modules to more faithfully represent how the economy really works. 
- It takes into account the temporal dynamics to analyze the short- and long-term effects of economic policies. 

## Files and Running the program
Philia1.0.zip include all the modules.

Philia-PRGM.docx displays the entire program by module in a WORD file.

Technicalappendix_PHILIA.docx describes the SFC model and all the equations.

To run the model in EVIEWS, you just need to launch 00-philia.

For each module, two files are available VP (for VARIABLES AND PARAMETERS) and EQ (for EQUATIONS).
